#JS Awesome Music Sheets - VexFlow and VexTab

I am a music fan, and for the moment I am looking (and building) tools that allows me to learn faster and better.

While looking JS tools for my new blog I found: [VexFlow](http://www.vexflow.com/)

Look at 0xFE genius github repos that contain vexflow and vextab source (MIT)

 - [All his repos](https://github.com/0xfe)
 - [VexTab](https://github.com/0xfe/vextab)
 - [VexFlow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow)
 
I believe it's amazing, and that is why I'm now working in embedding the system with my angularjs SSDC page.

The documentation is really well done (for formatting) and the tutorials are great!

There is a catch, there is no clear source code example on how to use vextab easily, so I read the source code of [this site](http://nextdoorhacker.com/music/2013/04/14/nicer-music-posts/) and did my modifications for the AngularJS directive based on his source. 

### VexTab example
Here I put an example (original example [here](http://www.vexflow.com/vextab/)):
</markdown>

<vextab>
options space=20

tabstave
  notation=true
  key=A time=4/4

  notes :q =|: (5/2.5/3.7/4) :8 7-5h6/3 ^3^ 5h6-7/5 ^3^ :q 7V/4 |
  notes :8 t12p7/4 s5s3/4 :8 3s:16:5-7/5 :h p5/4
  text :w, |#segno, ,|, :hd, , #tr


options space=25

tabstave
  notation=true

  notes :q (5/4.5/5) (7/4.7/5)s(5/4.5/5) ^3^
  notes :8 7-5/4 $.a./b.$ (5/4.5/5)h(7/5) =:|
  notes :8 (12/5.12/4)ds(5/5.5/4)u 3b4/5
