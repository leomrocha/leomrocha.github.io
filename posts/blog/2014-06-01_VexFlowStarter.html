#JS Awesome Music Sheets - VexFlow and VexTab

I am a music fan, and for the moment I am looking (and building) tools that allows me to learn faster and better.

While looking JS tools for my new blog I found: [VexFlow](http://www.vexflow.com/)

Look at 0xFE genius github repos that contain vexflow and vextab source (MIT)

 - [All his repos](https://github.com/0xfe)
 - [VexTab](https://github.com/0xfe/vextab)
 - [VexFlow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow)
 
I believe it's amazing, and that is why I'm now working in embedding the system with my angularjs SSDC page.

The documentation is really well done and the tutorials are great!

Here I put an exemple:
