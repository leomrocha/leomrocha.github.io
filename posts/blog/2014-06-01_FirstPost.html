#Experimenting with SSDC sites.

SSDC = Static Server - Dynamic Client

This is an experiment in handling completely static sites in the server side but all the behaviour and views generated in the client side.


This experiment has 2 main goals:

1. Experiment a concept I'd like to call SSDC
2. Make it easy for me to handle a blog
3. Learning AngularJS

All the experiment is written with AngularJS and is targetting mainly Github.


This project was born because I tried to configure Jekyll, but was quite a pain, specially when I needed new behaviours and plugins to be taken in account.


The Jekyll installation on Github is nice for afew basic things, but when the need arise to install plugins, either you compile everything before or you are dead.



##Advantages in relation to static site generators

1. Once all is configured, for writing new posts only pushing the new post file should work.
2. Will ease the development of new sites. All the 
3. Flexibility: adding new controllers and ways of handling data is handled in the JS code. No need to touch the backend
4. Searchability: as everything will be handled in the client side, the idea is to be able to search and filter ANY kind of information.

##Drawbacks
1. SEO, as everything is dynamically generated, I still don't know how will I manage this.


##Development Stages.

1. This first PoC will not handle too many things, the first idea is to be able to write posts in html code and let the platform handle it.
An index will be generated (manually or by a small script) in order to give all the data to the frontend for the list and search engine

2. The second stage will be making the platform check directly the paths on github and automatically generate the index.

3. The third stage will be dealing with SEO issues, and proposing different ways of handling the problem
