**Some things I made for fun on my free time**

I have a passion for trying new things, for reading, finding solutions to interesting problems. And I usually get caught on details that are irrelevant to the eye but meaningful for learning.

These projects are some of the things that arrived to a nice point and I feel that they are decent enough to be shown.

I decided not long ago that I should made of every project available for use of other people. And that there should be even in their minimum expression useful to somebody.


## Online Tuner

<!-- TODO put image here-->

Around beginings 2012 I was determined to start with web things, I got frustrated looking for a nice good online tuner and I spent a few months experimenting and fine tuning real-time web-based sound recongnition algorithms.

After trying with time-based and frequency-domain analysis I finally found something that could work well (and much more acurate than many of the other apps I was using) for me to feel confortable. Later I realized I'd never built anything graphic.... So I did it anyways.

## Real time transcription 


<!-- TODO put image here -->

Using the algorithm of the online tuner I wanted to make something more, so I started working on two things, expanding the algorithms for multi-pitch detection. The result was kind of slow but anyway I used the same interface for single and multi-pitch real-time transcription algorithm.

## Annotatit.com

I'm part of Toastmasters and something I wanted is to be able to review and have reviews online. Nothing was good enough so I created this service: ["AnnotatIt"](http://annotatit.com) that allows to write annotations to any YouTube video (It can work with some other services too) while one's watching and the notes will synchronize and draw nice graphics.

<!-- TODO demos -->


## MusicPaste

I found vexflow <!-- TODO link --> and vextab and wanted to start embedding the music sheets on my blog. First I started working on embedding directly but found out that an external service would be much more useful for other people to use it too.

So I created ["MusicPaste.com"](http://musicpaste.com) with the goal of creating a *pastebin for music*.

It's working nice enough and I'm actively using it for my blog.

There is a lot of work to add to it to make it even better.


##WMPK - Web Midi Piano Keyboard

One of the things I'm working on is building tools to help me learn music. This has 3 amazing positive points:

 1. I have lots of fun
 2. I learn a lot, about music and about technology
 3. I can share this to allow other people to use my tools, hopefully I'll help other people learn too!
 
So in this quest

## InteractifMusic

This is a basic demo of something I'm targeting as a medium-long term, building an online tool that allows people to learn music and teachers to have feedback from student practices.

At ["European Innovation Academy - Nice 2014"](http://inacademy.eu) we formed a team and ["InteractifMusic"](http://interactifmusic.com) was the result of the hackathon. We managed to validate some things but the business model is not clear enough yet.
