title: About Me
---

My name is Leonardo M. Rocha and I'm dedicated to software engineering in Data Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Analysis.


### A bit about me

I have worked in research and private enterprise environments for more than 12 years now which has given me a wide experience in different environments, techniques and technologies. 

Currently I work mostly with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) (with [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)) programming languages. For Deep learning I mostly use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

I am also fluent in Spanish, French and English and hold certifications in Agile methodologies and have experience working on-site and remotly.


Don't hesitate to [contact](./contact/) me if you have any questions or project that I might be of help.
