#Learn Music online playing your guitar


## Like duolingo but for MUSIC!! 

##Â Like Rockband with REAL INSTRUMENTS!!!


**This page is under havy work, and I'll be uploading notes quite often**
    
## Me:
**I'm Leo, I'm a Computer Engineer, I love playing my guitars and learning music**


I am working to be able to plug my guitar to the computer, and follow exercises and games that actually listen to what I play, and lets me know if it's right or wrong


##AWESOME NEED:

I NEED to be able to plug my guitar to the computer and have a personal teacher that guides and corrects me whenever I make a mistake.

I have to be able to see the error in real time

I have to be able to have a track record on how am I going

I have to be able to ask a teacher


    
###So, there are the following things on this
    
1. Business
2. Technology
3. Competition

### 1. Business

There is interest, you can see:

http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1gj0w3/

http://www.quora.com/Android-Applications/Is-there-an-application-like-Duolingo-for-music-education

### 2. Technology

This is what I do!!!

There are 3 parts on this:

1. music notation, well you can see some examples here
2. music transcription (software that listens to you and gets what you are playing or singing)
3. exercises!!

The technology is ready. Points **1** and **2** are already in a good state of the art (though there are things to do yet). We need to make the third part!

#### Examples:

The transcription algorithm is quite robust, needs flash and access to your microphone. Basically it listents to you and transcodes the notes (in multi-pitch mode) or one single note (in single pitch mode) Check the examples [here](http://leomrocha.github.io/soundtools/)

### 3. Competition

There are some other direct and indirect competitors, two years ago when I first started with this idea, there where some attempts, but no real things.

Now there are:

http://musikata.com/request_invitation.html  (more like I propose)

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tenuto/id459313476?mt=8 

http://www.musictheory.net/ (only theory, no instrument playing)
