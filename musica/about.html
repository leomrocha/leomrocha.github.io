#Learn Music online playing your guitar


## Like duolingo but for MUSIC!! 

##Â Like Rockband with REAL INSTRUMENTS!!!


**This page is under havy work, and I'll be uploading notes quite often**
    
## Me:
**I'm Leo, I'm a Computer Engineer, I love playing my guitars and learning music**


I am working to be able to plug my guitar to the computer, and follow exercises and games that actually listen to what I play, and lets me know if it's right or wrong


##IDEA:

The idea is to be able to plug my guitar to the computer and have a personal teacher that guides and corrects me whenever I make a mistake.

I have to be able to see the error in real time

I have to be able to have a record on how am I going

I have to be able to ask a teacher


    
###So, there are the following things on this
    
1. Business
2. Technology
3. Competition
4. Marketing
